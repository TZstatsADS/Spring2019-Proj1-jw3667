### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Do I Belong to Happiness?
+ This project is conducted by Jingwen Wang (jw3667)

+ Project summary: This project uses Happy_DB dataset, which is a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments via Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The main question is to discuss if there is a certain type of people that are happier than the rest of most. Data cleaning is processed before any analysis is conducted. Sentiment analysis is used to examine the overall happiness across all demographic groups. Later, we focus on the impact of Parenthood on happiness, and we uses topic modelling to summarize activities/experience shared by parents and non-parents groups of people. Interesting findings are obtained by visualizing the topic modelling results.
